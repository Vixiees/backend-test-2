## The Problem

**MeetingRooms Inc.** needs an API to manage meeting room reservations. The system must prevent booking conflicts.

---

## Business Rules

Each rule can be developed independently (git worktree compatible).

### BR1: No overlapping reservations
There cannot be more than one active reservation for the same room during the same time period.

### BR2: Maximum duration
A reservation cannot last more than 4 hours.

### BR3: Business hours only
Reservations can only be between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM, Monday through Friday.

### BR4: Capacity restriction by user
A regular user (non-admin) can only book rooms whose capacity is ≤ their `max_capacity_allowed`. Administrators can book any room.

### BR5: Active reservation limit
A user cannot have more than 3 active reservations (future and not cancelled). Administrators have no limit.

### BR6: Advance cancellation
A reservation can only be cancelled if there are more than 60 minutes until its start time.

### BR7: Recurring reservations
When creating a reservation with `recurring = 'weekly'` or `'daily'`:
- All occurrences must be created until `recurring_until`
- ALL occurrences must comply with rules BR1-BR5
- If any occurrence violates a rule, NO reservations are created
